The reason why we start by creating a repository is to add a `.gitignore` file. This file contains the names of files and directories that we want Github to ignore and not commit to Github. This is to avoid having huge repositories with files that are not useful for the collaborators. To read more about `.gitignore` files, [click here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/gitignore/).

The first step in an Express app is by creating a new repository in [Github](https://github.com/new).

Give your repository a name, then right above the `Create repository` button, there is an `Add .gitignore` option. Choose `Node`. Then click on the create button.

Your repository is all set, clone it and start building your project.
