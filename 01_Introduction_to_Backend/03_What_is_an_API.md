`API` stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface.

An `API` allows multiple software/programs to communicate with each other no matter what programming language is being used.

The applications communicate by making `requests` and receiving `responses`. The `responses` are in `JSON` format. There are different types of responses, but we will mainly be using `JSON`.

`JSON` is composed of `lists` and `dictionaries` and **every** programming language has `lists` and `dictionaries`. Because the `responses` are in `JSON` format, it doesn't matter what programming language is used to build the software.
